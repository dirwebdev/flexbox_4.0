# Flexbox 4.0 Project Overview

This project is centered around creating various layouts using Flexbox, emphasizing responsive and mobile-first design principles. The goal is to reinforce Flexbox concepts and apply them in practical scenarios.

## Project Goals

- **Responsive Layouts**: Ensure each layout adapts to different screen sizes using Flexbox.
- **Mobile-First Design**: Start with designing for smaller screens and then scale up with media queries.
- **Semantic HTML**: Utilize semantic HTML elements to structure content meaningfully.

## Key Elements

- Focus on using elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and more, avoiding `<div>` where possible.
- Each layout should start with a CSS reset and use `rem` or `em` units for typography to ensure accessibility and scalability.

## Development Process

- Utilize Git for version control, creating a new branch for each layout to maintain a clear history of development.
- Begin each layout with a clear plan, represented by an ASCII drawing to visualize the layout structure.

## Folder Structure

Each layout will be contained within its own folder under the `flexbox_4.0` parent directory, following a consistent structure for easy navigation and maintenance.

## Naming Conventions

Adopt a lowercase_underscore convention for CSS classes and IDs to maintain consistency and readability in the codebase.

## Workflow Instructions

1. **Start of Each Layout**:
    - Visualize the layout with an ASCII drawing.
    - Initialize a new Git branch for the layout.
    - Set up the required file structure and create a zip archive for distribution.

2. **Completion**:
    - Commit the completed layout to Git.
    - Push the changes to GitHub.
    - Prepare for the next layout following the same process.

This README serves as a guideline for the project's structure and objectives, ensuring each layout is approached with consistency and clarity.
